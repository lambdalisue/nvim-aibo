# Refactoring Summary

This document summarizes the changes made during the refactoring from the main branch.

## Major Changes

### 1. Terminology Update: Agent → Tool
- **Rationale**: Better reflects that the plugin works with any CLI tool, not just AI agents
- **Impact**: All references to "agent" in code and documentation changed to "tool"
- **Files affected**:
  - Renamed ftplugin files: `aibo-agent-*.lua` → `aibo-tool-*.lua`
  - Updated configuration: `agents = {}` → `tools = {}`
  - Updated all documentation

### 2. Module Reorganization
- **Console management**:
  - Split `console.lua` into `console_window.lua` and `prompt_window.lua`
  - Better separation of concerns between console and prompt functionality
- **Removed modules**:
  - `controller.lua` - Functionality merged into window modules
  - `send.lua` - Functionality integrated into prompt_window
- **New modules**:
  - `timing.lua` - Added debounce and throttle utilities
  - `integration/init.lua` - Centralized integration management

### 3. Test Suite Improvements
- **Reorganization**:
  - Moved tests from `tests/unit/` to `tests/internal/`
  - Renamed `test_runner.lua` to `runner.lua`
  - Added `mock.lua` for consistent test mocking
- **Coverage improvements**:
  - Added comprehensive tests for all command options
  - Added edge case testing for empty buffers, multiple consoles
  - Increased test count from 108 to 135 tests
  - Fixed timing-related test flakiness

### 4. Specific Test Enhancements

#### test_console_window.lua
- Added tests for all 9 public functions
- Added edge case tests for window management
- Added tests for error conditions

#### test_aibo_command.lua
- Added tests for opener option completion
- Added tests for stay option behavior
- Added tests for mutually exclusive options
- Added tests for invalid argument handling
- Added tests for all option combinations

#### test_aibo_send_command.lua
- Added tests for -submit option alone
- Added tests for M.setup function
- Added tests for empty buffer handling
- Added tests for multiple console selection
- Added tests for M.call function directly

## API Changes

### Configuration Structure
**Before:**
```lua
require('aibo').setup({
  agents = {
    claude = { ... }
  }
})
```

**After:**
```lua
require('aibo').setup({
  tools = {
    claude = { ... }
  }
})
```

### Function Name Changes
- `get_agent_config()` → `get_tool_config()`
- Agent-related internal functions renamed to use "tool"

## Documentation Updates

### README.md
- Updated all references from "agent" to "tool"
- Updated configuration examples
- Updated ftplugin file paths
- Clarified that the plugin works with any interactive CLI tool

### CONTRIBUTING.md
- Updated architecture section with new module structure
- Updated references from "agent" to "tool"
- Updated file paths to reflect reorganization

## Testing

All tests pass successfully:
- Total: 135 tests
- Passed: 135
- Failed: 0

Test improvements include:
- Better isolation using tabs
- Mocking of vim.ui.select to prevent blocking
- More robust timing tests using condition-based waiting
- Comprehensive coverage of all public APIs

## Migration Notes

For users upgrading from the previous version:
1. Update configuration from `agents = {}` to `tools = {}`
2. Update any custom ftplugin files from `aibo-agent-*` to `aibo-tool-*`
3. Update any references to agent-specific functions to use "tool" terminology

## Benefits of Refactoring

1. **Clearer terminology**: "Tool" better represents the plugin's versatility
2. **Better code organization**: Separated concerns between console and prompt
3. **Improved test coverage**: From 108 to 135 tests with better edge case handling
4. **More maintainable**: Clearer module boundaries and responsibilities
5. **Better documentation**: Updated to reflect actual capabilities and usage
